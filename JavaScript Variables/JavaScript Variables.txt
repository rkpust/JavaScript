JavaScript Variables


4 Ways to Declare a JavaScript Variable:

   * Using var
   * Using let
   * Using const
   * Using nothing

What are Variables?

Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values).

In this example, x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the var keyword: JS-Variable-var.html

In this example, x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the let keyword:
Example
let x = 5;
let y = 6;
let z = x + y;

In this example, x, y, and z, are undeclared variables:
Example
x = 5;
y = 6;
z = x + y; 


When to Use JavaScript var?

Always declare JavaScript variables with var,let, orconst.

The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.

The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.

If you want your code to run in older browsers, you must use var.
