JavaScript Variables


4 Ways to Declare a JavaScript Variable:

   * Using var
   * Using let
   * Using const
   * Using nothing

What are Variables?

Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values).

In this example, x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the var keyword: JS-Variable-var.html

In this example, x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the let keyword:
Example
let x = 5;
let y = 6;
let z = x + y;

In this example, x, y, and z, are undeclared variables:
Example
x = 5;
y = 6;
z = x + y; 


When to Use JavaScript var?

Always declare JavaScript variables with var,let, orconst.

The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.

The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.

If you want your code to run in older browsers, you must use var.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When to Use JavaScript const?

If you want a general rule: always declare variables with const.

If you think the value of the variable can change, use let.

In this example, price1, price2, and total, are variables: JS-variables-let/const.html


The two variables price1 and price2 are declared with the const keyword.

These are constant values and cannot be changed.

The variable total is declared with the let keyword.

This is a value that can be changed.

Just Like Algebra

Just like in algebra, variables hold values:
let x = 5;
let y = 6;

Just like in algebra, variables are used in expressions:
let z = x + y;

From the example above, you can guess that the total is calculated to be 11.

JavaScript Identifiers

All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.

These unique names are called identifiers.

Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

   * Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
   * Names must begin with a letter.
   * Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial).
   * Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
   * Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.

   #Note: JavaScript identifiers are case-sensitive.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Assignment Operator

In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.

This is different from algebra. The following does not make sense in algebra:
x = x + 5

In JavaScript, however, it makes perfect sense: it assigns the value of x + 5 to x.

(It calculates the value of x + 5 and puts the result into x. The value of x is incremented by 5.)


#Note: The "equal to" operator is written like == in JavaScript.
