JavaScript Programs

A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.

In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.

A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements.

#In HTML, JavaScript programs are executed by the web browser.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

JavaScript statements are composed of:

Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.

Most JavaScript programs contain many JavaScript statements.

The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written.

#JavaScript programs (and JavaScript statements) are often called JavaScript code.

Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.

When separated by semicolons, multiple statements on one line are allowed: a = 5; b = 6; c = a + b;

#On the web, you might see examples without semicolons.
#Ending statements with semicolon is not required, but highly recommended.

JavaScript White Space

JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable.

The following lines are equivalent:
let person = "Hege";
let person="Hege";

A good practice is to put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ):
let x = y + z;

--------------------------------------------------------------------

JavaScript Line Length and Line Breaks

For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters.

If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator:
Example

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"Hello Rezaul!"; 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

JavaScript Code Blocks

JavaScript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets {...}.

The purpose of code blocks is to define statements to be executed together.

One place you will find statements grouped together in blocks, is in JavaScript functions:

Example: JS-Codeblocks.HTML

#In this tutorial we use 2 spaces of indentation for code blocks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

JavaScript Keywords

JavaScript statements often start with a keyword to identify the JavaScript action to be performed.

Here is a list of some of the keywords you will learn about in this tutorial:

Keyword 	Description

var 	    Declares a variable
let 	    Declares a block variable
const 	    Declares a block constant
if 	        Marks a block of statements to be executed on a condition
switch 	    Marks a block of statements to be executed in different cases
for 	    Marks a block of statements to be executed in a loop
function 	Declares a function
return 	    Exits a function
try 	    Implements error handling to a block of statements

#JavaScript keywords are reserved words. Reserved words cannot be used as names for variables.
