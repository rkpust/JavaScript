JavaScript Programs

A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.

In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.

A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements.

#In HTML, JavaScript programs are executed by the web browser.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

JavaScript statements are composed of:

Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.

Most JavaScript programs contain many JavaScript statements.

The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written.

#JavaScript programs (and JavaScript statements) are often called JavaScript code.

Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.

When separated by semicolons, multiple statements on one line are allowed: a = 5; b = 6; c = a + b;

#On the web, you might see examples without semicolons.
#Ending statements with semicolon is not required, but highly recommended.
