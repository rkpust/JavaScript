JavaScript Programs

A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.

In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.

A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements.

#In HTML, JavaScript programs are executed by the web browser.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

JavaScript statements are composed of:

Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.

Most JavaScript programs contain many JavaScript statements.

The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written.

#JavaScript programs (and JavaScript statements) are often called JavaScript code.

Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.

When separated by semicolons, multiple statements on one line are allowed: a = 5; b = 6; c = a + b;

#On the web, you might see examples without semicolons.
#Ending statements with semicolon is not required, but highly recommended.

JavaScript White Space

JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable.

The following lines are equivalent:
let person = "Hege";
let person="Hege";

A good practice is to put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ):
let x = y + z;

JavaScript Line Length and Line Breaks

For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters.

If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator:
Example

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"Hello Rezaul!";
